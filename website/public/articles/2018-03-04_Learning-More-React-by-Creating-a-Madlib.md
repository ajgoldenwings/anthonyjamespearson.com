# Learning More React by Creating a Madlib

First off, if you want to go straight to the Madlib click <a href="http://www.madlib.anthonyjamespearson.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

This was built with React, of course, but I used <a href="https://material-ui-next.com/" target="_blank">Material-UI</a> for the nice interface. As of now, I am wishing I could find more time to break up the Vertical Linear Stepper component. Most of the Madlib exists in this file. It is close to 400 lines of code. If you get past that, this would be perfect to use to expand into a full Madlib website.

Anyway, I hope you get a couple of laughs. Comment if you are pleased!
