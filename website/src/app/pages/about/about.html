        Welcome to my personal website! I'm Anthony James Pearson, a passionate developer
        with over 10 years of deep knowledge of full-stack software development with a wide latitude of domain knowledge in capital markets, manufacturing, insurance, education, e-commerce, criminal justice, <abbr title="Emergency Medical Services">EMS</abbr>, and laboratories.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is designed for fellow learners like you, and I hope it helps you tackle your challenges along the way. It's already been a lifesaver for me countless times—especially when I'm building new websites and can't quite remember how to set things up.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am hoping to use this site to tell the stories of battle (wins or losses), new <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> technologies, <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr> serverless infrastructure code, and other unrelated technical topics.
      </p>

          This site is meant to serve you. Okay, yeah, maybe it might be promoting myself. But I don't see you doing anything about it, so buzz off, haters. I'm just kidding—come back, I love you. Hey, just an alert: if you see anyone hating, especially if it's me, hit them in the arm for me and tell them to not hate me cuz they ain't me.
