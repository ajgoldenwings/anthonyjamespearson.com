        <p>
          Welcome to my personal website! I'm Anthony James Pearson, a passionate developer
          with over 10 years of deep knowledge of full-stack software development with a wide latitude of domain knowledge in capital markets, manufacturing, insurance, education, e-commerce, criminal justice, EMS, and laboratories.

          This site is designed for fellow learners like you, and I hope it helps you tackle your challenges along the way. It's already been a lifesaver for me countless times—especially when I'm building new websites and can't quite remember how to set things up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am hoping to use this site to tell the stories of battle (wins or losses), new AI technologies, AWS serverless infrustructure code, and other unrealated technical topics.

            This site is meant to serve you. Okay, yeah, maybe it might be promoting myself. But I don’t see you doing anything about it, so buzz off, haters. I’m just kidding—come back, I love you. Hey, just an alert: if you see anyone hating, especially if it’s me, hit them in the arm for me and tell them to not hate me cuz they ain't me.
